## Attribution

Thanks to Colby of D4 for providing excellent math documentation for calculating encounter difficulty! This is built using the XP Thresholds provided by [Wizards of the Coast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/building-combat-encounters?srsltid=AfmBOooA9WzfSuu415gJV3He3ww56tWbNak7_EwjsdtYFp7J1M8J_6G3). Monsters are also courtesy of the SRD put out by Wizards of the Coast.

## Next Steps
- Add options for encounter difficulty calculations (basic, standard, advanced)
- Add pagination for monsters
- Add filtering for monsters
